# TASKTERROR
Introducing my annoying ToDo CLI app, made in Rust! This project serves as a learning journey for me to become more familiar with Rust and also a capstone project from ZeroPoint Security, so expect bad codes along the way lol. Nevertheless, feel free to check it out and provide some valuable feedback if there's something to improve.

## Reminders
- This is made for personal use
- If you don't have rust installed on your machine, then go to the official website of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- I'm not responsible for any errors that may occur on your machine. Please use with caution.
